# AmazingStrangers

Hackathon orgainzed by Capital One.

As a team of 6 people (two front end developers, a designer, three back-end developers and a strategist) we worked on solving Second Harvest's (a food charity) problem.

The problem statement: How to capture and organize data of raffle tickets (around 15,000) that are sold during their annual fund-raising event. Currently, the data related to raffle tickets is handled manually.
